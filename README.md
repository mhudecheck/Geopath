# Geopath
Description: Geopath provides a series of functions for calculating path routes and route distances without the use of an external data provider.  It includes functions for importing OSM PBF files, determining the optimal routes between two or more coordinate paris, estimating transit times for two or more coordinate pairs, and reverse geocoding latitude and longitude coordinates.  All of the calculations are done on the host machine, meaning that users no longer have to rely on outside APIs, such as Google Maps or Bing, for planning optimal routes, estimating transit times, or reverse geocoding coordinates.
